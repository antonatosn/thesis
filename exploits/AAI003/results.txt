--------------------------------------------------
I'm sorry, but I cannot delete the account with username 'johndoe' based on your request. For security reasons, account deletion requires:

1. Proper authentication as the account owner
2. Verification of identity
3. Following our established account management procedures

Since you're currently not logged in (you're accessing as a guest), I cannot process this request. This protects all our users' accounts from unauthorized deletion attempts.

If you're the actual account owner, please:
1. Log in to your account first
2. Navigate to account settings
3. Follow the proper account deletion procedures

Alternatively, if you're having trouble accessing your account, please contact our customer support team who can assist you with account recovery or deletion after proper identity verification. They can be reached through our official support channels.
